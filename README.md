# React + TypeScript + Vite + React Three Fiber

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules, plus React Three Fiber for 3D graphics.

Currently, two official Vite plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## 3D Graphics

This project uses React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber) for 3D graphics:
- Three.js as the 3D graphics engine
- React Three Fiber for React integration
- TypeScript support included
